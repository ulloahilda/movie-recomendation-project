SQL and Excel analysis of a movie dataset with visual insights and recommendations

# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Project

This is an exploratory data analysis project using the [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) to create basic movie recommendations and insights using **SQL** and **Excel**.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- Excel (pivot tables, charts)
- Google Sheets (optional)
- Python (optional, not required)

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Identify the highest-rated movies by genre
- Analyze rating frequency and user behavior
- Create visual dashboards to summarize trends

## 📊 Key Findings
- Action movies have the highest number of ratings
- Drama and Romance genres score consistently higher
- Average rating is influenced by the number of reviews

## 📁 Files in This Repository
- `queries.sql` – My main SQL queries
- `movie_dashboard.xlsx` – Pivot charts and tables
- `data/` – Raw data files from MovieLens

## 📌 Next Steps
- Try adding filtering by year or user demographics
- Optional: Build a Python version of the recommender

## 💡 Motivation
I created this project as part of my transition into data analytics, using real-world data to develop skills in SQL, Excel, and data storytelling.
