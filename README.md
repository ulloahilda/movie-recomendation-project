# Movie Ratings Analysis Using SQL

Welcome to my beginner SQL data analysis project! This project explores user movie ratings using a public dataset and basic SQL queries. It's my first step toward transitioning into the data analytics field.

## 📁 Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Imported data into SQLite using DB Browser
- Explored a dataset containing movie titles and user ratings
- Joined datasets to analyze patterns in movie preferences
- Wrote and tested SQL queries to answer real-world questions

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and contains:

- `movies.csv`: Movie titles and genres
- `ratings.csv`: User IDs, movie ratings, and timestamps

> These files were imported and queried in SQLite using DB Browser (free tool).

## 🔍 Questions I Explored

Here are a few questions I answered with SQL:

- What are the most rated movies?
- Which movies have the highest average rating?
- How many users rated each movie?
- What are the most popular genres?

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQLite** via **DB Browser for SQLite**  
- **SQL** for querying and analysis  
- **GitHub** to document and share this project

## 📁 Files Included

- `movies.csv`
- `ratings.csv`
- `movie_analysis.sql` — my SQL queries
- `README.md` — you’re reading it!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
2. Open DB Browser and import `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` as tables
3. Run the queries in `movie_analysis.sql`

## 🙋 About Me

My name is Hilda Ulloa. I’m transitioning from math education and finance into data analytics. I built this project to sharpen my SQL skills and start building a data portfolio.

## ✨ Future Plans

- Add visualizations (in Python or Google Sheets)
- Explore genre trends
- Try out more SQL joins and subqueries
